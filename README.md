TUDU is a project i have been working on since 2022, when I decided to learn JavaScript and webstorage-databases.
It uses JSON structures to store the id, text, time and date together and rearange it at the main page.

This image is the first front page i created for the To Do list, in 2022:

At december 2023, I "reopened", as for realized the front page was not that good. So I built a new one :)
Which is this:

I also added the scrool structure so it does not DESAPEAR from the page when their are too many TODO sections. haha

Moreover I needed to add some "sauce", if you know what I mean, so I user ':hover' and ':active' to create buttons interactions.

I am now workin at a way to create different lists at the same time, probably I'll use an Id as List-variable 
so I can change lists with a buttons like:  | < | | > |. Anyways.
